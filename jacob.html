<h1>   Over complication and resurgence of simplicity</h1>
<p class="essay_jake">
    The evolution of games has played a role in everyone’s lives, leaving an impact that some can recall on especially with the development of<a id="link_white" href="mady.html"> technology </a>that has dramatically transformed the way we interact with games. This advancement has led for games to also evolve from simple arcade games to a new type of storytelling. In between the ‘old’ <a id="link_white" href="nelleke.html">technology</a> such as the Nintendo 64, and the infamous Gameboy advance, the emerging internet started to mature and transform how we interact with these platforms. From simple gameplay to almost overwhelming amount of options, the<a id="link_white" href="jelle.html"> complexity </a> of games can be distorted by the overlapping interfaces that we interact with.

<br>

    Recently a game called “Fortnite” has shocked the gaming <a id="link_white" href="nelleke.html">community</a> with over 30 million players in less than 6 months. It has gained a large media presence from clips on<a id="link_white" href="mady.html"> Facebook </a> to news outlets where mom’s brainstorm how to restrict their children from playing too much. Much of this attention had me wondering why this game works so well, and some of the implications it might come with. 

First, the game takes a fundamental that everyone can associate such as health and armor that emulates which can be traced back to the Doom HUD. HUD (head-up display) or status bar is the method by which information is visually relayed to the player as part of a game's <a id="link_white" href="jelle.html">user </a>  interface. The classic Doom interface stood out as it contains the <a id="link_white" href="mady.html">structure </a>followed by Fortnite from health/armor to weapons and ammo. Doom serves as an example of far games have progressed from the old chunky interfaces to a more flat centric design.

<br>

    The interface allows the user to easily identity what is accessible for a smoother gameplay. To better understand this concept of why Fornite’s HUD works towards the user, examining a screen capture of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds will highlight the problematic layout. PubG is a game similar where the player plays against up to 100 players and is<a id="link_white" href="myrna.html"> challenged</a> to survive. Since it came out prior to Fortnite and the obvious similarities, it is safe to presume they examined the gameplay. Although there are immediate differences such as the graphics, we can view the HUD and suggest why this game may has fell off to<a id="link_white" href="myrna.html"> users </a> preferences and attention. (The game screen captures come from the streaming platform twitch.) This will be made a point later on but let’s view the interface. 

    Two key points will be used to<a id="link_white" href="nelleke.html"> analyze </a> the interface, the immediate accessibility available to the user, and the options presented to the user. 

<br>

    Typical to first person shooters, the weapon and ammo is clearly presented but all other items available are stored away in a secondary menu that offers the user with more customization. This not only disrupts the gameplay but also may initially overwhelm the user with options. The attempt to compartmentalize the items into sections helps but the amount of detail presented offers too much <a id="link_white" href="jelle.html">information</a> making it appear complicated. 

    What Fortnite (third image) does in contrast is offer the player the immediate use of all items from the HUD and anything specific can be accessed more in depth in the secondary menu. This completely gets rid of any interruption of the gameplay and makes the<a id="link_white" href="myrna.html"> content</a> of the game available at any time. This is important especially for new players, as the player is only presented with a set amount of options, the <a id="link_white" href="mady.html">learning </a> curve to understand the game is low. In UI/UX terms this can be thought as the onboarding <a id="link_white" href="jelle.html">process</a>. Fortnite’s use of limited options helps guide users to make quick decisions rather than specific customization that overwhelms the user such as scope variation or weapon clips.

The area where treats hit markers react accordingly and offer a trigger a user can easily recognize and offers a reward. The notifications and reactions between user and interface 
co-exist as the notifications only appear after the user commits to decisions. The placement of the modules make the interface appear balanced, separating the different types of information. 

    These types of intentional interface designs allows the users to minimally get affected by the game HUD interface, rather the interface is a successful display of information. Using the interface as a tool the user relies on, it creates a model that hooks the user to the platform, similar to that of popular <a id="link_white" href="myrna.html"> social media </a> apps. The shear simplicity of the game and accessibility creates a sense of balance while avoiding the complexity of <a id="link_white" href="jelle.html"> overloading</a> the game. It truly gathers the core concepts of what a game should entail and fully highlights that experience that can be translate cross-platform. Streamers such as Ninja have played with celebrities such as Drake, gathering an audience of more than 400,000 people while playing. In regards to video platforms such as twitch and youtube, it has quickly gained a large following of online gameplay since it is being proven to be so entertaining.
