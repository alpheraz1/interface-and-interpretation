visibility of the <a id="link_cyan" href="jacob.html">interface</a> <br>
thesis by jelle van bouwhorst
<br>
<br><br>
An interface is a <a id="link_cyan" href="nelleke.html">space</a> between human users and machines. It disciplines, limits and determines what can be done in a digital environment. Due to the evolution of the interface, we are now dependent on this complicated space that is constantly being optimized. Wikipedia describes an interface like: “Man and machine can not (yet) communicate with each other without problems.” (Interface, Wikipedia, 2018) The language of <a id="link_cyan" href="myrna.html">communication</a> that is understandable to a person (words and images) is not the same as the information way of the interface (ones and zeros). Would it be possible in the <a id="link_cyan" href="nelleke.html">future</a> for an interface to operate as a <a id="link_cyan" href="mady.html">human</a> being?
<br><br>
All images have a point of view where a systematic construction can be achieved. This construction can be translated to an interface. Johanna Drucker appointed Nielsen Norman who positions a <a id="link_cyan" href="jacob.html">user</a> by means of orthographic systems. This <a id="link_cyan" href="myrna.html">system</a> works from expectations and experiences and gives meaning to how the user reads a text with, for example, tracking results. He describes this as unworkable fiction that you can work with. Steve Krug describes the interaction between man and computer in his <a  id="link_cyan" href="nelleke.html">book</a> ‘Do not Make Me Think’. The starting point of the book is that a good <a  id="link_cyan" href="mady.html">software</a> program or a website must enable users to carry out their desired assignment as easily and directly as possible. He points out to the reader that we design very specifically. Parts that need to be read are at the top, below that there must be a pause and it ends with a well-chosen <a id="link_cyan" href="nelleke.html">link</a>. In reality, the visitor quickly scans the page looking for usable information, something to click on to get to the target more quickly, titles that have vague what to do with the description and if this does not work they will click on the back button again to search. The visit to an interface is nowadays almost a fast slot <a id="link_cyan" href="myrna.html">Machine</a>. Hope you found your goal as quickly as possible.

Rafaël Rozendaal shows with his work Abstract Browsing (2016) that web pages are made up of many elements, information that is organized and categorized. This tool can be installed on your web browser and gives you the possibility to make an interface visible. This ensures that the layer of ones and zeros is changed in image.
Websites are constantly being <a id="link_cyan" href="nelleke.html">updated</a> to maximize their efficiency, regardless of aesthetic considerations. content<a id="link_cyan" href="mady.html">Facebook</a> (see image) is a good example of a complicated interface. If you compare this with the interfaces of an artistic website (see previous pages) you can conclude that they are much more human. It don’t really work with systems and there is less categorized <a id="link_cyan" href="jacob.html">content</a>. The Rafaël tool does not work and this means that the website does not actually have a real interface.
<br><br>
A website like pornhub.com can be compared to the website mywdka.nl. The same content<a id="link_cyan" href="mady.html">structure</a> in interface is used, but something completely different is communicated. An interface that works with a layout where you are looking for something and where you probably want to view several things. Facebook and news websites work with a horizontal interface. Lots of different information divided into horizontal areas through which you can scroll through. Webshops use a large area in which they display their products. Sometimes the larger the areas are, the more expensive the products.
<br><br>
We <a  id="link_cyan" href="nelleke.html">process</a> a lot of information online. From <a id="link_cyan"  href="myrna.html">complex</a>non-personal interfaces to interfaces that almost manage to communicate with you. Would we be able to manage in the future that an overload of information such as on Facebook can be made very personal and can be displayed in a simple interface? Only that is what we want? Maybe we want to keep that content<a id="link_cyan" href="jacob.html">overload</a> of information and get lost in the <a id="link_cyan" href="nelleke.html">information</a>. And we like that all news sites have a unique interface, so we know how to search.
