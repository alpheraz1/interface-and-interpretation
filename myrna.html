<h1>   Interfaces make us stupid</h1>
<p class="essay_jake">
An interface is a medium between man and machine. We need the machines to make tasks easier in our lives, but they are difficult to communicate with. An interface has been created for this, so non-technical people can still communicate with <a id="link_white" href="nelleke.html">machines</a>.

If you look at the monkey stay in a zoo, we see that the caretakers hide the food in tricky objects, because the food in the wild is not for the taking. The monkeys have an activity with an attractive <a id="link_white" href="nelleke.html">purpose</a>. The object is an interface. The monkey knows that there is food in it and this can be won in a certain way. With us, as humans, the opposite is done, because we are served everything. Why do we make it so easy for ourselves, but can we see that it is important for another <a id="link_white" href="nelleke.html">species</a> to keep the instinct?

Interfaces you see more and more around you and they are made easier by the day. For example, if you want to create a website, you do not need to learn HTML and CSS anymore. There are enough websites where you can build a website with a few clicks. With a little knowledge, you therefore, come a long way. We need our brains less and less when using <a id="link_white" href="jelle.html">complex</a> systems. Only the person who makes the interface uses his brain, but perhaps not when it comes to the <a id="link_white" href="jacob.html">user's</a> own good.

Conventions are the main culprits for the interface. A convention is
a way of behaviour that has become customary. An example of this is a menu at the top of a website. You know that you can <a id="link_white" href="nelleke.html">navigate</a> this and see an overview of the entire website. A new website can therefore easily be introduced because the user would already use the <a id="link_white" href="jelle.html">system</a>. When a website deviates from common interfaces and conventions, it is difficult for the user to understand the website.

It all started when computer manufacturers realized that computers would not be used if the user could not have direct <a id="link_white" href="mady.html">communication</a> with the system. In the first instance, a computer could only be controlled with text-based <a id="link_white" href="mady.html">commands</a>. You would have to learn that first, but nobody starts doing that. Nowadays this text runs in the background with icons on the front that we can click with a mouse, which the computer manufacturers have developed so that everyone can use the computer, which is, of course, a commercial <a id="link_white" href="nelleke.html">idea</a>.


Of course I see the positive aspects of an interface and I use them myself. I am especially concerned about the <a id="link_white" href="jelle.html">future</a>future where we make every system simple and people are brain-dead icons-clickers, which already happens with <a id="link_white"  href="jacob.html">social media</a>. It is especially important with what interfaces you come into contact with. A <a  id="link_white" href="jelle.html">book</a> is also an interface. You know what the front is, how to scroll, that you can still browse, you can close the book and put it in a closet. However, I am convinced that these types of interfaces can only add something to our <a id="link_white" href="nelleke.html">knowledge</a>. According to Scientists at the University of Liverpool, reading has a therapeutic effect, reduces stress, trains your ability to concentrate, improves your social <a id="link_white"  href="mady.html">skills</a>, is memory training, brings better social economic status, and finally, you become more tolerant from.

We must be critical of the interfaces we use and be aware of the added value. If an interface is easy to use, you can consider using it only if its <a id="link_white"  href="jacob.html">content</a> has a higher level. The makers of interfaces can also choose to create a certain <a  id="link_white" href="jacob.html">challenge</a> in the use of the system, just like the monkeys in a zoo.

I advocate making systems more difficult and training our brains.
