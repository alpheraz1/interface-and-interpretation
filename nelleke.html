<p class=essay_nelleke>In Graphesis Johanna Drucker mentions the book of the <a id="link_white" href='myrna.html'>future</a>. She says that the book of the future will combine reading and writing, annotation, social media, text <a id="link_white" href='jacob.html'>processing</a> and analysis, data mining, mind mapping, searching and <a  id="link_white" href='jelle.html'>linking</a>, indexing, display, image parsing and distant reading in a multi-modal, cross-platform intermedia environment. The book will arise from an <a id="link_white" href='jacob.html'>analysis</a> of the
functions of each element of design for <a id="link_white" href='myrna.html'>purposes</a> of <a id="link_white" href='myrna.html'>navigation</a>, orientation, representation, reference, and commentary and then rethink the ways the capacities of networked electronic environments can extend these functionalities and encode them in an innovative approach to design.
<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the <a  id="link_white" href='jelle.html'>book</a> of the future will manifest itself more in a way in that it becomes a part of us. The book of the future will become a big collection of information much like wikipedia. It will be constantly <a id="link_white" href='jelle.html'>updated</a> with new information. When new information is found or rectified, it will be added or adjusted in the book right away. The book only exists in our collective minds. We all add to the <a id="link_white" href='jacob.html'>community</a> of information. 
<br>
<br>
This is quite similar to the collective consciousness, also known as the Hive Mind, that is used by the Borg in Star Trek. The minds of the borg drones are all telepathically connected allowing them to communicate through sub<a  id="link_white" href='jelle.html'>space</a> (subspace is a feature of space-time in Star Trek that facilitates faster-than-light transit, in the form of interstellar travel or the transmission of information).This results in a powermind that renews its <a id="link_white" href='mady.html'>information</a> which in turn produces an all-knowing, or at least ultra-intelligent, being. Next to sharing the information with each other, they also select individuals and races to assimilate to reach ultimate perfection. 

<br>
<br>
In reality
<br>
Of course the idea of the Hive Mind is based on hive insects such as bees and ants. Although hive insects do not <a id="link_white" href='mady.html'>communicate</a> by using some sort of telepathy but by scents or body language. They use the vibration of their movements or the smell of their wings to transfer a message to their species.
<br>
<br>
There are already technologies being designed to allow our brains to communicate with <a id="link_white" href='myrna.html'>machines</a>. For instance the wireless implants by Braingate that gives severely disabled people the ability to control their wheelchair with thought. That same <a id="link_white" href='jacob.html'>technology</a> could one day be used to communicate with other brains. 

<br>
<br>
In the future
<br>
What would it look like if that theory becomes a reality one day? It would be the ultimate <a id="link_white" href='mady.html'>interface</a> because it would not need any explanation. It would make complete sense right away, since it is our own mind. With every <a id="link_white" href='myrna.html'>idea</a> it would become better. It would be visible in the way our individual ideas are visible now. The advantages of this book of the future would be <a id="link_white" href='myrna.html'>knowledge</a> that expands at a speed that has never before been reached. In this way our <a id="link_white" href='myrna.html'>species</a> will be able to make big steps in our development in fields such as technology and healthcare. We will live longer and more efficiently.
